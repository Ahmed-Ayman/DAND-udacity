# DAND Udacity.

Aloha there!

I'm a DAND graduate student, here you can see my [Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/4K3PCGDX), I've been interested and passionate about the Data science that's why I applied for the NTL [scholarship](http://techleaders.eg/) and got accepted in the Data analyst nano degree program.

The DAND program was divided into 2 semester, it took me around 4 months to finish the first and another 4 months to finish the 2nd since I was just 
super busy with college, full time development job and another Google Challenge also on Udacity.

feel free to clone my work and edit it or use it for any legal purpose.
